 <p>The term “cyberbullying” refers to when an individual (usually an adolescent) is the target of humiliation, harassment, and at times even threats from another person or group via electronic technology.</p>

<h2>How do does Cyberbullying happen?</h2>
<p>Cyberbullying can exist in a myriad of electronic domains. Devices such as computers, cellphones, and tablets are used as mediums to put forth hurtful and damaging comments about another child. Cyberbullying does often occur through text messages, phone calls/VOIP, and emails, however the primary avenue for this behavior stems from social media sites. Other adolescents will at times use social media to spread rumors, post embarrassing pictures/videos, create fake profiles of whomever they are harassing, or simply just posting cruel remarks about others.</p>
<h2>Who is being Cyberbullied?</h2>
<p>In order to classify as cyberbullying, both parties (the victim and the bully) have to be children, pre-teens, or teenagers. If and adult gets involved in the “bullying” process, it then becomes cyber harassment or cyber stalking which have their own respective legal ramifications. </p>



<h2>Is it really a big deal?</h2>
<p>Adolescence in general is generally a tumultuous time in everyone’s life. Between hormones, growth spurts, and trying to discern who you are and where you fit, it becomes a trying time. Now imagine as you are trying to figure all of this out you are being ostracized, ridiculed, or even threatened with bodily harm for being “different” so everyone you know can see. The fact this form of constant teasing can have a pervasive and significant effect on the victims. To the point that many kids have not been able to handle the torment experienced in their life and so have committed suicide. It is a travesty to have our youth be so afraid of who they are, that they would rather take their life rather than live with the insurmountable pain afflicted by their peers. It just simply has to stop.</p>
