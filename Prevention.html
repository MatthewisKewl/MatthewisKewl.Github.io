We need to address ways they can become a cyber-bystander. Teach them how to be accountable for their actions and not to stand by and allow bullying (in any form) to be acceptable. We need to teach them not to ignore the pain of others and to be proactive when encountered with hurtful comments.Parents and schools can also play important roles in preventing this from happening. Parents should try to be more involved in their children’s internet usage and exhibit a mutual concern about lewd content as well as hurtful comments. Schools can also teach and enforce anti cyber bullying policies aswell. Many schools have adopted a zero tolerance policy for bullying on their school grounds and even extended this to cyber bullying as well.<h2>Creative Technological Solutions</h2><p>Since social media sites are the primary forums for cyber bullying to transpire, several new features could hypothetically but put into place to help prevent or limit this. For children under the age of 15 would have to get a randomly generated authenticator number in order to log in to their site. This authentication code would be given to their parent’s cell phone or email whenever they try to log in. This would require the child to consult with their parent before using such websites, making the parent aware when and what their child is doing on the internet.</p><div class="footnote"><ol>  <li><a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">http://www.stopbullying.com/</a></li>  <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joachim_s_mueller/">  https://www.cyberbullying.gov/</a></li>  <li><a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">http://www.wikipedia/cyberbullying.com</a></li></ol></div></div>   </div></body></html>
